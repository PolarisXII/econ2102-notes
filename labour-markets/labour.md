# Labour Markets

## Supply and Demand

### Overview
- Demand for labour is sloped downwards due to diminishing returns on MPL (marginal product of labour).
- Labour supply is upwards as the opportunity cost of leisure increases as wages rise. 
- Wage is determined by the equilibrium of labour demand and supply. 

### Change in Supply
- If the government collects income tax: 
Supply curve shifts left as it lowers the overall wage level in the economy. Wages will rise but employment levels will fall. 

### Change in Demand
- If the government implements labour laws that makes it harder to fire workers: 
Demand curve shifts left as all firms will demand less workers, causing both wages and employment to fall. 

### Wage rigidity
- When wages fail to adjust to labour supply and demand:
In the above example where labour demand shifts to the left, if wages fail to adjust, it will result in a larger fail in employment.

## Bathtub Model of Unemployment:

### Summary:
 $E_t + U_t = L_t$
$\delta U_{t+1} = \bar sE_t - \bar fU_t$

Endogenous variables: E (Employment) and U (Unemployment)
Exogenous variables: $\bar s$ (job separation rate), $\bar f$ (job finding rate) and $\bar L$ (Labour force).

The change in unemployment equals to the number of previously employed people who have lost their job ($\bar sE_t$) minus the number of previously unemployed people who have found a job ($\bar fU_t$).


### Solving the Model:
#### 1. Unemployment: 
***Set the change to unemployment to zero, then isolate $U_t$***
Let $\delta U_{t + 1} = 0$
$ \bar sE_t  = \bar fU_t$
$ \bar s(\bar L_t - U_t)  = \bar fU_t$
$U^* = \frac{\bar s \bar L}{\bar f + \bar s}$

#### 2. The natural rate of unemployment: 
$u^* = \frac{U^*}{L} = \frac{\bar s}{\bar f + \bar s}$

### Insights: 
- The only way to alter the natural rate of unemployment rate is to change the job finding rate or job separation rate.

## Human Capital

### Present Discount Value

- The value of money you would need to put in the bank today
to equal a given future value.
- $PDV = \frac{future\space value}{(1 + interest \space rate)^T}$

- ***For a series of payments of amount $A$ over a period of time $T$ at interest rate $R$***, its present discounted value is given by: 
$$pdv = A \cdot \frac{1 - (\frac{1}{1 + R})^T}{1 - (\frac{1}{1 + R})}$$

- Therefore, assuming that a person's average income per year is $56000, works for 45 years over their lifetime and the interest rate stays at 3%. The pdv of their lifetime earning would be given by 

$$pdv = \$56000 \cdot \frac{1 - (\frac{1}{1 + 3\%})^{45}}{1 - (\frac{1}{1 + 3\%})} \cong \$140,0000$$
